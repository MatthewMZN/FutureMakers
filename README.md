## What I Hope To Learn
### 7/6/2021

One of the main reasons I am here is because I am afraid of computer scienc. I always have been. Since attending my first coding course at Berkeley, I've struggled immensely not only with the involved logic of computer programming, but mustering the curiosity necessary to solve the puzzles programming is embedded in. I suppose failing that first course may have also had something to do with that. It's been a thorn in my side for a quite a while now, and each time some new overzealous engineering professor wants to assign coding homework problems, I get anxious and and mentally unhinged. I'm afraid of coding. I'm afraid of how much I don't know, of being the weakest link in group projects, and afraid that I am not smart enough to not only engage with the material but to master it. So when I saw the opportunity to work with MIT Raise and Surestart this summer, I sought to change how I felt. 

In this program I hope to learn the basic fundamentals of computer programming in Python. I am striving to establish mental tools and templates on how to approach problem sets from a computer's logical perspective, and understand how to redesign alternative (optimized) routes to solve problems and improve my default methodologies. Furthermore, I hope to learn how to balance my dependency on others with my own contribution to group work. I tend to overthink, hit roadblocks, ask for help, and eventually just copy for all intents and purposes. I want to contribute more than another another mouth to feed, and I am hoping that Surestart can teach me how. 

In addition to my self edification and anxiety, I also hope to improve my ability to code in the context of animation. As an aspiring animation producer, I understand that one of the default coding languages for studio software is Python, and that it is necessary to understand how to design in Python just as much as it is with pencil. I am here to establish a sense of direction and possibility for myself as an animator and storyteller, and improve my versatility in storytelling as much as possible.

## Dr. David Kong | Leadership & Storytelling
### 7/7/2021

Dr. Kong affirmed that I am on the right path in my life. When sharing my story of growth and personal acceptance, I aimed to create a narrative that was new in its composition. I've lievd through all the details myself, and have even shared my thoughts about my journey in other ways before to close friends. But working with Dr. Kong, I chose to present the information using his storytelling methods (challenge, choice and outcome) to complete strangers, and it not only deepened my comprehension of self, but it reminded me how much I enjoy the unnnerving complete vulnerability can cause. After I shared, the back of knees were drenched. I was scared but exhilerated to have the opportunity to give my testimony to the room in a new way, and I felt utterly fulfilled after I did. I love storytelling. I love how it unites people, how it cultivates a hunger for groundedness and embraces reflexivity, and how it shows people themselves--sometimes raw and imperfect. I want to create stories in animation and theme park design that do the same. Dr. Kong helped affirm that. 

I believe my purpose is to bring messages of humanity to people, intergenerationally. I feel my purpose lies within entertainment, with networking, with world building and character designing. There is no better feeling than impregnanting a thought with elements of your own character and sense of self, and having people embrace it firsthand. Dr. Kong mentioned that it is possible to share narratives with others as a conduit for conveying purpose. For me, that is the only way I _can_ do it. Who I am is a composition of the expereinces and teachings I've been blessed with, and the only way I have learned to unconver my purpose within my composition, is to unearth myself to others. Those continuous efforts enlightened me on how impactful my story, my presence, and my voice all really are. When I share my life, I feel validated, seen, uplifted and encouraged. And then I realized that my purpose was to _continue sharing_. And I began to see how much of a difference it makes--from the people I surround myself with, to the way I perceive the world, to what others find possible in their lives that once may not have been. The manifestation of my implicit truths have garnered beautiful experiences for me 10x over, and it is my purpose to share my wealth with the rest of the world. So that's exactly what I'm going to do. 

## Short Answer Responses

1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

(A) Supervised Learning is a type of ML that incorporates labels (classes) within the training data as it input into the algorithm. Additionally, Supervised Learning provides feedback to the computer directly to assist it in its ability to predict correct outcomes. This is primarily used in elements of Regression & Classification Models.
Unsupervised Learning incorporates training data without any labels or classes. Additionally, there is no external feedback on whether the predictions or actions it is performing are correct. Instead, the machine must learn from patterns whether or not it is functioning appropriately. In order to achieve this, we use clustering do showcase the similarities between multiple features that can be used to identify patterns in the algorithm.

2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

(A) The Scikit-Learn program is an open source library that is built on Pandas and other data analysis libraries. In fact, it was designed specifically for data mining and analysis such as feature extraction & normalizaition, regression, clustering, etc. It needs analysis libraries in order to achieve this functionality.

## Deep Learning in Real World Problems
### 7/9/2021

(Problem) COVID-19 Propogation based on racial diversity in America. There has been confirmation that members of low-income, mainly black, neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by the SarsCoV2 virus since its discovery back in 2019. Using a section of historical positive case data and population denisty data (compartmentalized by race), it may be possible to train an algorithm to predict which cities are at highest risk, ordered by race. This is not to prioritize any race over another, but rather to showcase a potentially systemic flaw in health care distribution, environmental conditions in urban and rural areas, and which communities suffer from preexisting conditions. Understanding these patterns and correlations may help hospitals allocate medical resources, remote service locations, vaccine resources, and more. 

I'm not too sure the best algorithm to apply for this type of project, however I would wager either Support Vector Machines or Decision Trees may be most beneficial for this task. The SVM algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. Apparently it is mostly used in classification problems. SVM transforms the data base on it, finds an optimal boundary between the possible outputs. 

The SVM Algorithm
1. Define an optimal hyperplane with a maximized margin
2. Map data to a high dimensional space where it is easier to classify with linear decision surfaces
3. Reformulate problem so that data is mapped implicitly into this space

SVM has been used consistently in Bioinformatics to classify proteins, genes, malignant cells, etc. Understanding that, I think it shows promise for classifying positive test subjects and compartmentalizing them by location, yielding predictive analytics for labeled categories. 

I also think Decision Trees may also be a promising algorithm. A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decision-making process and the possible consequences. It covers event outcomes, resource costs, and utility of decisions. Decision Trees resemble an algorithm or a flowchart that contains only conditional control statements. This could be a beneficial model for outlining allocation of resourcesm based on concentration of positive testing  individuals within a limited radius.
