## Day 1 | What I Hope To Learn 
### 7/6/2021

#### Action Item : 
Create a section in your README or wiki called Responses to add reflections or answers for each activity. Remember to mark each response with the associated date. For Day 1’s reflection, reflect on what you hope to learn in this program.

### Reflection : 
One of the main reasons I am here is because I am afraid of computer scienc. I always have been. Since attending my first coding course at Berkeley, I've struggled immensely not only with the involved logic of computer programming, but mustering the curiosity necessary to solve the puzzles programming is embedded in. I suppose failing that first course may have also had something to do with that. It's been a thorn in my side for a quite a while now, and each time some new overzealous engineering professor wants to assign coding homework problems, I get anxious and and mentally unhinged. I'm afraid of coding. I'm afraid of how much I don't know, of being the weakest link in group projects, and afraid that I am not smart enough to not only engage with the material but to master it. So when I saw the opportunity to work with MIT Raise and Surestart this summer, I sought to change how I felt. 

In this program I hope to learn the basic fundamentals of computer programming in Python. I am striving to establish mental tools and templates on how to approach problem sets from a computer's logical perspective, and understand how to redesign alternative (optimized) routes to solve problems and improve my default methodologies. Furthermore, I hope to learn how to balance my dependency on others with my own contribution to group work. I tend to overthink, hit roadblocks, ask for help, and eventually just copy for all intents and purposes. I want to contribute more than another another mouth to feed, and I am hoping that Surestart can teach me how. 

In addition to my self edification and anxiety, I also hope to improve my ability to code in the context of animation. As an aspiring animation producer, I understand that one of the default coding languages for studio software is Python, and that it is necessary to understand how to design in Python just as much as it is with pencil. I am here to establish a sense of direction and possibility for myself as an animator and storyteller, and improve my versatility in storytelling as much as possible.

## Day 2 | Dr. David Kong | Leadership & Storytelling
### 7/7/2021

### Who is Dr. David Kong?
Director, Community Biotechnology Initiative
Research Scientist

David Sun Kong, Ph.D. is a Synthetic Biologist, community organizer, musician, and photographer based in Lexington, MA.  He is the Director of the MIT Media Lab's new [Community Biotechnology Initiative](https://www.media.mit.edu/groups/community-bio/overview/). Their mission: Empowering communities through biotechnology.

David conducted his graduate studies at MIT’s Media Lab, receiving a Master's degree for developing technology for printing nanostructures with energetic beams and a Ph.D. for demonstrating the first gene synthesis in a microfluidic (“lab-on-a-chip”) system. He was recognized as an emerging leader in synthetic biology as a "LEAP" fellow, served as a guest faculty member at the Marine Biology Lab in Woods Hole, MA, and is co-founder and managing faculty of "How To Grow (Almost) Anything," an international course on synthetic biology. He founded and chaired new Microfluidic and Hardware Tracks for the [International Genetically Engineered Machines Competition (iGEM)](https://igem.org/Main_Page) and is the official iGEM DJ. He was Technical Staff in the Bioengineering Systems & Technologies group at MIT’s Lincoln Laboratory and a founding member of the synthetic biology team.

He has also worked as a community organizer for more than a decade and is the founder of [EMW](http://www.emwbookstore.com/), an art, technology, and community space in Cambridge, MA. EMW's mission is to empower communities through the transformative power of artistic expression. We emphasize serving marginalized communities and develop all of our programming with values rooted in social justice. Our community programs explore expressive forms ranging from poetry to electronic music, beatboxing to bio-hacking and more.

### Action Item:
For Day 2’s reflection, reflect on what you learned in Dr. David Kong’s leadership seminar about yourself, the world, and what are your unique contributions to your local and global community.

### Reflection: 
Dr. Kong affirmed that I am on the right path in my life. When sharing my story of growth and personal acceptance, I aimed to create a narrative that was new in its composition. I've lievd through all the details myself, and have even shared my thoughts about my journey in other ways before to close friends. But working with Dr. Kong, I chose to present the information using his storytelling methods (challenge, choice and outcome) to complete strangers, and it not only deepened my comprehension of self, but it reminded me how much I enjoy the unnnerving complete vulnerability can cause. After I shared, the back of knees were drenched. I was scared but exhilerated to have the opportunity to give my testimony to the room in a new way, and I felt utterly fulfilled after I did. I love storytelling. I love how it unites people, how it cultivates a hunger for groundedness and embraces reflexivity, and how it shows people themselves--sometimes raw and imperfect. I want to create stories in animation and theme park design that do the same. Dr. Kong helped affirm that. 

I believe my purpose is to bring messages of humanity to people, intergenerationally. I feel my purpose lies within entertainment, with networking, with world building and character designing. There is no better feeling than impregnanting a thought with elements of your own character and sense of self, and having people embrace it firsthand. Dr. Kong mentioned that it is possible to share narratives with others as a conduit for conveying purpose. For me, that is the only way I _can_ do it. Who I am is a composition of the expereinces and teachings I've been blessed with, and the only way I have learned to unconver my purpose within my composition, is to unearth myself to others. 

Those continuous efforts enlightened me on how impactful my story, my presence, and my voice all really are. When I share my life, I feel validated, seen, uplifted and encouraged. And then I realized that my purpose was to _continue sharing_. And I began to see how much of a difference it makes--from the people I surround myself with, to the way I perceive the world, to what others find possible in their lives that once may not have been. The manifestation of my implicit truths have garnered beautiful experiences for me 10x over, and it is my purpose to share my wealth with the rest of the world. So that's exactly what I'm going to do.

## Day 3 | Introduction to Machine Learning & Scikit-Learn
### 7/8/2021

### Lesson Plan: 
Reviewed Machine Learning Models & Algorithms using this [article](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer). 

### Action Item: 
1. Used this [Simple Model Development Activity](https://towardsdatascience.com/an-introduction-to-scikit-learn-the-gold-standard-of-python-machine-learning-e2b9238a98ab) to familiarize myself with Scikit-Learn.

2. Post short answers to the following questions:
  
  A. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
  
  B. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the
power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data
analysis libraries.

### Reflection:
1. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?

(A) Supervised Learning is a type of ML that incorporates labels (classes) within the training data as it input into the algorithm. Additionally, Supervised Learning provides feedback to the computer directly to assist it in its ability to predict correct outcomes. This is primarily used in elements of Regression & Classification Models.
Unsupervised Learning incorporates training data without any labels or classes. Additionally, there is no external feedback on whether the predictions or actions it is performing are correct. Instead, the machine must learn from patterns whether or not it is functioning appropriately. In order to achieve this, we use clustering do showcase the similarities between multiple features that can be used to identify patterns in the algorithm.

2. Describe why the following statement is FALSE: Scikit-Learn has the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

(A) The Scikit-Learn program is an open source library that is built on Pandas and other data analysis libraries. In fact, it was designed specifically for data mining and analysis such as feature extraction & normalizaition, regression, clustering, etc. It needs analysis libraries in order to achieve this functionality.

### Supplemental Activity: [ADD]
Designed a Machine Learning Model using a [ML Kaggle Activity](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/your-first-machine-learning-model)

## Day 4 | Deep Learning in Real World Problems
### 7/9/2021

### Lesson Plan:
Approached a high-level understanding of Deep Learning models & algorithms using this [article](https://serokell.io/blog/deep-learning-and-neural-network-guide).

### Action Item:
Think about a real-world problem and see if you can find a dataset that has the
characteristics of the data of that problem. Then, think about the deep learning
algorithm that you would likely use to develop a solution to it. Outline why you
picked a particular approach and share the dataset

### Reflection:
(Problem) COVID-19 Propogation based on racial diversity in America. There has been confirmation that members of low-income, mainly black, neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by the SarsCoV2 virus since its discovery back in 2019. Using a section of historical positive case data and population denisty data (compartmentalized by race), it may be possible to train an algorithm to predict which cities are at highest risk, ordered by race. This is not to prioritize any race over another, but rather to showcase a potentially systemic flaw in health care distribution, environmental conditions in urban and rural areas, and which communities suffer from preexisting conditions. Understanding these patterns and correlations may help hospitals allocate medical resources, remote service locations, vaccine resources, and more. 

I'm not too sure the best algorithm to apply for this type of project, however I would wager either Support Vector Machines or Decision Trees may be most beneficial for this task. The SVM algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification or regression challenges. Apparently it is mostly used in classification problems. SVM transforms the data base on it, finds an optimal boundary between the possible outputs. 

The SVM Algorithm
1. Define an optimal hyperplane with a maximized margin
2. Map data to a high dimensional space where it is easier to classify with linear decision surfaces
3. Reformulate problem so that data is mapped implicitly into this space

SVM has been used consistently in Bioinformatics to classify proteins, genes, malignant cells, etc. Understanding that, I think it shows promise for classifying positive test subjects and compartmentalizing them by location, yielding predictive analytics for labeled categories. 

I also think Decision Trees may also be a promising algorithm. A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decision-making process and the possible consequences. It covers event outcomes, resource costs, and utility of decisions. Decision Trees resemble an algorithm or a flowchart that contains only conditional control statements. This could be a beneficial model for outlining allocation of resourcesm based on concentration of positive testing  individuals within a limited radius.

# MIT FutureMakers | Week 2
## Day 7 | The Nature and Capacity of TensorFlow
### 7/12/2021

### Lesson Plan:
Familiarized myself with multiple Deep Learning Libraries.

1. [TensorFlow Library](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tensorflow-tutorial)
2. [Keras Library](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/deep-learning-python?utm_source=adwords_ppc&utm_campaignid=1658343521&utm_adgroupid=63833880615&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=keras&utm_matchtype=p&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=&utm_creative=319519154328&utm_targetid=aud-299261629654:kwd-295071417107&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=9016565&gclid=CjwKCAiAxp-ABhALEiwAXm6IyQJo6LA_Z4HlQUiBhrfFwOFL3Vu0bDTjMI53og6hcZfeWIkzEZRBTxoCzbkQAvD_BwE)

### Action Item:
Write about or record a video of yourself answering the following questions:

1. What are "Tensors" and what are they used for in Machine Learning?
2. What did you ntoice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?

### Reflection:
1. What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?

(A) Right off the bat, the tutorial states that "tensors" are multidimensional data arrays. Thinking aloud as I type, I'd say such arrays seem to be combinations of basis/unit vectors and components of a specific coordinate system within a vector space. Like a vector, tensors represent "objects" using mathametical relationships between said objects and the coordniate systems/vector space they exist in. Tensors subsume vectors as representational objects that define other algebraic object, vectors, or other tensors, as they are  ahigher order function that are represented using an array of numbers that are a function of "dimensional space x rank(dimension of the vector space generated by its columns). In short, tensors are algebraic representations of unit vectors and vector space components in the form of data that represent the multidimensional orientation of another object within a vector space.

2. What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?

(A) I suppose that all of the outputs printed in the interactive models were in the form of arrays. I noticed that the multiplication of the x1, x2 variables in the model produced a 1x4 row vector, with each element as the multiplicative result of the same elements in each array. So, is this to say that algebraic operations on tensors will always result in tensors? Other operations could potentially yield other classes of tensors, like scalars, should the rank of the array go to zero. What's also interesting is that the tutotrial claims that interactive sessions need to be ran in order for the quantifiable values of tensors to be printed, however in Google Colab the values are automatically printed without need to initialize a sesison. The information is printed alongside the arrays. 

The other computations regarding the transformation of the image data set was light, if that. Mainly the tutorial presented various ways to extract features and standardize image sizes, but other than that there weren't any noticeable computations that I was aware of.
